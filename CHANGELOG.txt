ULOS 21.05-pre1:
  *  First pre-release.
  *  Supports booting from managed filesystems.
  *  Has a relatively straightforward installation process.
  *  All core functionality should be mostly stable.

ULOS 21.05-pre2:
  *  Second pre-release.  
  *  Better-optimized MTAR loader.

ULOS 21.05-pre3:
  *  Third pre-release.
  *  Optimized the MTAR loader slightly further.
  *  Fixed a typo in 'login'.
  *  'passwd' can now remove users.
  *  New coreutil: 'less' pager.
  *  New coreutil: 'tfmt' text formatter.

ULOS 21.06-pre4:
  *  Fourth pre-release.
  *  There are now manual pages for all core utilities and libraries.
  *  A long-standing TTY bug has been fixed - long lines ending at the edge of the screen should now wrap properly.
  *  There is now a 'text.wrap' function, which wraps text and ignores (but preserves) VT100 escape sequences while doing so.

ULOS 21.06-pre5:
  *  Fifth pre-release.
  *  The Cynosure kernel now features opt-out pre-emptive multitasking, through hijacking load().
  *  There is now a MOTD in /etc/motd.txt, which /bin/login will display on logging in.
  *  LSH supports semicolon-separated commands, though the implementation leaves much to be desired.
  *  Added a mostly-complete LuaFileSystem compatibility layer.
  *  LSH's `into' builtin now supports executing programs directly, if passed the '-p' option.

ULOS 21.06-pre6:
  *  Sixth pre-release.
  *  Cynosure's pre-emptive multitasking has been significantly improved.
  *  Fixed a typo in the 'futil' library's manual page.

ULOS 21.06-1.0:
  *  First release.
  *  The ULOS Package Manager is implemented and working.
  *  Cynosure now has networking support.  Currently, this is only implemented for the internet card, but support for other forms of networking can and will be transparently added in the future.
  *  Cynosure's buffer implementation now behaves as expected when reading 0 bytes from a file.
  *  Fixed a small bug with Cynosure's pre-emptive multitasking implementation.
  *  install:  There is now an option to use UPM for installation, rather than copying from the live media.  Only available if an internet card is installed.
  *  mtar:  The MiniTel ARchive library now properly unarchives files, and the behavior of the unarchiver function has as a result changed slightly.  (Unarchiver code credit: Izaya)
  *  There are several new manual pages (man, tfmt, upm, and UPM's included libraries config and serializer).

ULOS 21.06-r1.1:
  *  Release 1.1.
  *  There is now a readline() library for improved line editing, and an accompanying manual page.
  *  The shell and the Lua REPL now both use the new readline() library.
  *  There have been numerous fixes and additions to UPM:
    >  The `search` command now indicates whether the specified package is installed.
    >  There is now a `list` command, which lists all installed packages in no particular order.
    >  There is now an `upgrade` command, which upgrades all out-of-date packages on the system.
  *  Fixed a very small bug with the Cynosure VT100 emulator wherein cursor wrapping did not work properly in one very specific case.
  *  Added the `sv` command for service management, and a corresponding manual page.
  *  Merged the `coresvc` and `refinement` packages.
  *  Refinement now sets `__metatable` on the table returned from `sv.list()`.
  *  Added the `uname` command, identical to `print(_OSVERSION)`.

ULOS 21.06-r1.2:
  *  Release 1.2.
  *  Added category selection ('installed', 'all', and per-repository) to UPM's 'list' command.
  *  LSH's program exit status filter has been improved slightly;  it will no longer print 'exited' or blank exit statuses.
  *  UPM now has a copyright notice in its help text.
  *  UPM now automatically resolves package dependencies.
  *  UPM's package installation process has been refined:  it will now resolve dependencies, *then* download packages, *then* install them.  Previously it would download and install each package individually.
  *  A piece of debug code that could cause unexpected behavior has been removed from Cynosure.
  *  Cynosure's TTY cursor can now be toggled.
  *  Syntax highlighting is now included in the 'tle' package.
  *  /etc/motd.txt is now included in the 'coreutils' package.
  *  The release image now includes an 'installed.list', so that a system installed using the offline method will be upgradeable using UPM.
  *  A small bug with the readline() library has been fixed.
  *  Added a basic 'more' pager.

ULOS 21.07-r1.3:
  *  Release 1.3.
  *  There is now an optional `getgpu()` function, for getting the GPU bound to a specific TTY.
  *  Several breaking bugs in Cynosure's kernel argument parsing code have finally been fixed.
  *  Cynosure now features proper hostname support in its network API.
  *  Refinement has gained support for loading and saving the hostname from /etc/hostname during startup and shutdown.
  *  The /etc/rf/ttys script now sets {stdin,stdout,stderr}.tty to the ID of the attached TTY;  for example, 2.  Previously it would be set to `true`.
  *  UPM's `search` functionality now matches on patterns, rather than requiring the full package name; this does not impact installation or removal.
  *  There is now a `hostname` utility for getting and setting the system hostname.
  *  There are now manual pages for `more`, the `sysfs`, `getgpu`, the `network` API, and `edit`.
  *  Manual pages can now be viewed in a web browser at https://oz-craft.pickardayune.com/man/ulos.
  *  Typos in a few manual pages have been fixed.
  *  UPM has been split into a library and a command;  this is entirely for speed reasons and the library is not intended for use in other programs.
  *  The `config` and `serializer` libraries are now in the `corelibs` package rather than the `upm` package, as they are now dependencies of Refinement.
  *  The `config` library's `bracket` type now saves entries in the order they were loaded.  This has the downside of making new entries slightly more complicated to create.
  *  The `termio` library now has a `cursorVisible()` function, for setting cursor visibility.
  *  `sv.list()` now behaves correctly.
  *  The `find` command now prints usage to the standard error if no arguments are specified.

ULOS 21.07-r1.4:
  *  Release 1.4.
  *  UPM now displays progress bars while downloading packages, as well as the total download size before package installation.
  *  Fixed a bug with the Cynosure `sysfs`'s TTY handler not properly flushing the TTY stream.
  *  Cynosure's `sysfs` now exports handle templates' `flush` functions where it previously did not.
  *  `rm` no longer chokes under certain situations.
  *  The Cynosure Loader's default kernel flags now reduce kernel output during boot.
  *  Cynosure's terminal emulator now does not act on ctrl-D while raw mode is enabled.  The old behavior was considered a bug.
  *  The `sv` command can now add, remove, and control autostart of services.
       >  The `sv` API has functions for this accordingly.
  *  The `package.protect` function has been fixed to that `pairs` and `ipairs` behave properly on the protected table.
