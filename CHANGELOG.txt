ULOS 21.05-pre1:
  *  First pre-release.
  *  Supports booting from managed filesystems.
  *  Has a relatively straightforward installation process.
  *  All core functionality should be mostly stable.

ULOS 21.05-pre2:
  *  Second pre-release.  
  *  Better-optimized MTAR loader.

ULOS 21.05-pre3:
  *  Third pre-release.
  *  Optimized the MTAR loader slightly further.
  *  Fixed a typo in 'login'.
  *  'passwd' can now remove users.
  *  New coreutil: 'less' pager.
  *  New coreutil: 'tfmt' text formatter.

ULOS 21.06-pre4:
  *  Fourth pre-release.
  *  There are now manual pages for all core utilities and libraries.
  *  A long-standing TTY bug has been fixed - long lines ending at the edge of the screen should now wrap properly.
  *  There is now a 'text.wrap' function, which wraps text and ignores (but preserves) VT100 escape sequences while doing so.

ULOS 21.06-pre5:
  *  Fifth pre-release.
  *  The Cynosure kernel now features opt-out pre-emptive multitasking, through hijacking load().
  *  There is now a MOTD in /etc/motd.txt, which /bin/login will display on logging in.
  *  LSH supports semicolon-separated commands, though the implementation leaves much to be desired.
  *  Added a mostly-complete LuaFileSystem compatibility layer.
  *  LSH's `into' builtin now supports executing programs directly, if passed the '-p' option.

ULOS 21.06-pre6:
  *  Sixth pre-release.
  *  Cynosure's pre-emptive multitasking has been significantly improved.
  *  Fixed a typo in the 'futil' library's manual page.

ULOS 21.06-1.0:
  *  First release.
  *  The ULOS Package Manager is implemented and working.
  *  Cynosure now has networking support.  Currently, this is only implemented for the internet card, but support for other forms of networking can and will be transparently added in the future.
  *  Cynosure's buffer implementation now behaves as expected when reading 0 bytes from a file.
  *  Fixed a small bug with Cynosure's pre-emptive multitasking implementation.
  *  install:  There is now an option to use UPM for installation, rather than copying from the live media.  Only available if an internet card is installed.
  *  mtar:  The MiniTel ARchive library now properly unarchives files, and the behavior of the unarchiver function has as a result changed slightly.  (Unarchiver code credit: Izaya)
  *  There are several new manual pages (man, tfmt, upm, and UPM's included libraries config and serializer).

ULOS 21.06-1.1:
  *  Release 1.1.
  *  There is now a readline() library for improved line editing, and an accompanying manual page.
  *  The shell and the Lua REPL now both use the new readline() library.
  *  There have been numerous fixes and additions to UPM (namely: upgrade, list, and an installation status indicator in the output of search).
  *  Fixed a very small bug with the Cynosure VT100 emulator wherein cursor wrapping did not work properly in one very specific case.
