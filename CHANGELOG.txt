  *  There are now manual pages for all core utilities and libraries.
  *  A long-standing TTY bug has been fixed - long lines ending at the edge of the screen should now wrap properly.
  *  There is now a 'text.wrap' function, which wraps text and ignores (but preserves) VT100 escape sequences while doing so.

ULOS 21.06-pre5:
  *  Fifth pre-release.
  *  The Cynosure kernel now features opt-out pre-emptive multitasking, through hijacking load().
  *  There is now a MOTD in /etc/motd.txt, which /bin/login will display on logging in.

  *  Added a mostly-complete LuaFileSystem compatibility layer.
  *  LSH's `into' builtin now supports executing programs directly, if passed the '-p' option.

ULOS 21.06-pre6:
  *  Sixth pre-release.
  *  Cynosure's pre-emptive multitasking has been significantly improved.
  *  Fixed a typo in the 'futil' library's manual page.

ULOS 21.06-1.0:
  *  First release.
  *  The ULOS Package Manager is implemented and working.
  *  Cynosure now has networking support.  Currently, this is only implemented for the internet card, but support for other forms of networking can and will be transparently added in the future.
  *  Cynosure's buffer implementation now behaves as expected when reading 0 bytes from a file.
  *  Fixed a small bug with Cynosure's pre-emptive multitasking implementation.
  *  install:  There is now an option to use UPM for installation, rather than copying from the live media.  Only available if an internet card is installed.
  *  mtar:  The MiniTel ARchive library now properly unarchives files, and the behavior of the unarchiver function has as a result changed slightly.  (Unarchiver code credit: Izaya)
  *  There are several new manual pages (man, tfmt, upm, and UPM's included libraries config and serializer).

ULOS 21.06-r1.1:
  *  Release 1.1.
  *  There is now a readline() library for improved line editing, and an accompanying manual page.
  *  The shell and the Lua REPL now both use the new readline() library.
  *  There have been numerous fixes and additions to UPM:
    >  The `search` command now indicates whether the specified package is installed.
    >  There is now a `list` command, which lists all installed packages in no particular order.
    >  There is now an `upgrade` command, which upgrades all out-of-date packages on the system.
  *  Fixed a very small bug with the Cynosure VT100 emulator wherein cursor wrapping did not work properly in one very specific case.
  *  Added the `sv` command for service management, and a corresponding manual page.
  *  Merged the `coresvc` and `refinement` packages.
  *  Refinement now sets `__metatable` on the table returned from `sv.list()`.

  *  Release 1.2.
  *  Added category selection ('installed', 'all', and per-repository) to UPM's 'list' command.
  *  LSH's program exit status filter has been improved slightly;  it will no longer print 'exited' or blank exit statuses.
  *  UPM now has a copyright notice in its help text.
  *  UPM now automatically resolves package dependencies.
  *  UPM's package installation process has been refined:  it will now resolve dependencies, *then* download packages, *then* install them.  Previously it would download and install each package individually.
  *  A piece of debug code that could cause unexpected behavior has been removed from Cynosure.
  *  Cynosure's TTY cursor can now be toggled.
  *  Syntax highlighting is now included in the 'tle' package.
  *  /etc/motd.txt is now included in the 'coreutils' package.
  *  The release image now includes an 'installed.list', so that a system installed using the offline method will be upgradeable using UPM.
  *  A small bug with the readline() library has been fixed.
  *  Added a basic 'more' pager.

ULOS 21.07-r1.3:
  *  Release 1.3.
  *  There is now an optional `getgpu()` function, for getting the GPU bound to a specific TTY.
  *  Several breaking bugs in Cynosure's kernel argument parsing code have finally been fixed.
  *  Cynosure now features proper hostname support in its network API.
  *  Refinement has gained support for loading and saving the hostname from /etc/hostname during startup and shutdown.
  *  The /etc/rf/ttys script now sets {stdin,stdout,stderr}.tty to the ID of the attached TTY;  for example, 2.  Previously it would be set to `true`.
  *  UPM's `search` functionality now matches on patterns, rather than requiring the full package name; this does not impact installation or removal.
  *  There is now a `hostname` utility for getting and setting the system hostname.
  *  There are now manual pages for `more`, the `sysfs`, `getgpu`, the `network` API, and `edit`.
  *  Manual pages can now be viewed in a web browser at https://oz-craft.pickardayune.com/man/ulos.
  *  Typos in a few manual pages have been fixed.
  *  UPM has been split into a library and a command;  this is entirely for speed reasons and the library is not intended for use in other programs.
  *  The `config` and `serializer` libraries are now in the `corelibs` package rather than the `upm` package, as they are now dependencies of Refinement.
  *  The `config` library's `bracket` type now saves entries in the order they were loaded.  This has the downside of making new entries slightly more complicated to create.
  *  The `termio` library now has a `cursorVisible()` function, for setting cursor visibility.
  *  `sv.list()` now behaves correctly.
  *  The `find` command now prints usage to the standard error if no arguments are specified.

ULOS 21.07-r1.4:
  *  Release 1.4.
  *  UPM now displays progress bars while downloading packages, as well as the total download size before package installation.
  *  Fixed a bug with the Cynosure `sysfs`'s TTY handler not properly flushing the TTY stream.
  *  Cynosure's `sysfs` now exports handle templates' `flush` functions where it previously did not.
  *  `rm` no longer chokes under certain situations.
  *  The Cynosure Loader's default kernel flags now reduce kernel output during boot.
  *  Cynosure's terminal emulator now does not act on ctrl-D while raw mode is enabled.  The old behavior was considered a bug.
  *  The `sv` command can now add, remove, and control autostart of services.
       >  The `sv` API has functions for this accordingly.
  *  The `package.protect` function has been fixed to that `pairs` and `ipairs` behave properly on the protected table.
  *  The `config` library's `bracket` preset now saves `nil` values.
  *  UPM will now remove files that a package stops owning after an upgrade.
  *  The Cynosure TTY's maximum buffer size is now 2048 bytes.  This may change or become configurable in the future.

ULOS 21.08-r1.5:
  *  Release 1.5.
  *  Cynosure's `os.exit()` function now behaves properly.
  *  `readline` now accepts the `noexit` option to not exit when ctrl-D is pressed.
  *  `readline` now accepts a `complete` function, which is given the current text buffer and a session ID and expected to make something of it.
  *  The default task time limit is now 0.1s, down from 0.5s.  This does not have a noticeable impact on performance and improves responsiveness while programs loop.
  *  A few improvements have been made to the Lua REPL.
  *  Cynosure now has a `sound` API.
  *  Fixed a bug with Cynosure's `load()` wrapper pre-emption scheme causing `coroutine.yield()` to misbehave.
  *  There is a new kernel option, `no_wrap_coroutine`, which disables Cynosure's `coroutine` wrapper for userspace only.
  *  `\27[0m` now properly resets the TTY's foreground and background colors.
  *  `io.popen` now sometimes works, but should not be relied upon.
  *  `/usr/lib` is now in the default package path.
  *  There is a new installer, `installer`, and the old one has been moved to `minstall`.
  *  Both installers now assist in the adding of users, creation of home directories, and hostname setup.
  *  There are two new commands, `mkpasswd` and `hnsetup`, which should only be used during system installation.
  *  Cynosure now provides a `tty` interface for using the kernel's TTY driver on userspace-provided GPU objects.
  *  Cynosure's terminal emulator supports an "xoff" mode, where all input is suspended.  Use with caution.
  *  The `getgpu` function has been moved into the `tty` API.  Programs will need to be updated to reflect this.
  *  Cynosure's terminal emulator now supports `\27[0;X;Y;W;Hg` to clear only specific areas of the screen.  More GPU functions may be added in the future.
  *  The `gpuproxy` API is now its own package.
  *  There is now an option for the release image to autostart the installer.  Download `release_noautostart.lua` if you do not want the installer to autostart; it can still be autostarted by running `installer` from the command line.
  *  The default Message Of The Day has been changed.

ULOS 21.08-r1.6:
  *  Release 1.6.
  *  The ULOS Web Site is now live at https://ocawesome101.github.io/ulos.
  *  The ULOS Window Manager, `uwm`, is now available as a package in the `extra` repository.
  *  The Open System's GUI has been mostly ported as the `osgui` package.
  *  A bug with the Cynosure terminal where signals would still be sent even if `XOFF` was set has been fixed.
  *  Programs can now detect if they're running with a `gpuproxy`-created proxy, with the `isProxy` field.
  *  The Cynosure Loader now calls loaded files with `xpcall()` for traceback support.
  *  A few bugs with `gpuproxy`'s `buffer` wrapper have been fixed.
  *  Cynosure's `loadfile()` now behaves properly when given an environment.
  *  The `extra` repository is now included in UPM's default configuration.
  *  Cynosure's `process.kill` function now behaves correctly.
  *  There is finally a `mv` command.
  *  Fixed a bug with Cynosure's `load()` wrapper wherein signals would sometimes be either duplicated or not sent.
  *  The Cynosure TTY implementation now behaves as expected when given `\27[nnG`.
  *  Refinement's `sv.list()` now returns more data.
  *  Updated `sv` to reflect this.
  *  The `require()` function has been moved from Refinement into Cynosure.  This enables running any userspace software as init with the `init=PATH` kernel argument.
  *  Some scheduler weirdness with process environments has been sorted.
  *  The IO stream passed to `init` now has the `tty` field set.
  *  Cynosure's TTY now supports negative numbers as arguments.
  *  Added `\27[1;XX;YY;WW;HH;RX;RYg` as an interface to `gpu.copy`.
  *  Cynosure now supports displaying a boot splash on startup.
  *  Refinement's logger has been updated to look slightly nicer with Cynosure's bootsplash enabled - the standard logger will be used if the bootsplash is not enabled.
  *  The kernel command line is now accessible through `/sys/cmdline`.
  *  Cynosure's `users.usermod` function now behaves correctly.
  *  The `passwd` command will only prompt for a password if the user being modified is not the current user OR if no arguments have been passed, but not, for example, if changing the shell.
  *  Cynosure's TTY now has 24-bit color support through the `\27[{3,4}8;2;RRR;GGG;BBBm` extension.
  *  `login` now prints the value of `_OSVERSION` and the TTY ID rather than just `Welcome to ULOS.` since the first line of the MOTD is `Welcome to ULOS!`.
  *  Fixed a bug with the Cynosure TTY's output line buffer where it would sometimes not flush properly.
  *  Cynosure's TTY should now mostly support UTF-8 input and output.
  *  USysD has replaced Refinement as the default init system.
  *  Cynosure's `io.lines()` function now behaves as expected.
  *  The Cynosure TTY's "XOFF" mode now disables output as well as input.
  *  Cynosure's `users.exec_as` function now returns the PID of the process it spawned if the `wait` argument is not specified.  It also now supports a sixth argument, `stdio`, which sets *all* input and output streams of the spawned process to the provided stream.  Finally, a password is now required only if the user calling the function is not `root`.
  *  Cynosure's `io` library now canonicalizes paths.  This is an improvement over the previous system that required a userspace hack.
  *  There is now a `quit` signal in `process.signals`.
  *  There is now a file `/etc/os-release` containing a set of key-value pairs describing the OS.  This is in a similar format to the standard Linux file of the same name.
  *  There is now an official ULOS logo.
  *  There is now an official Cynosure logo.
  *  There is now a standalone ULOS installer for OpenOS using a badly ported version of UPM, as well as a script to download and boot the latest release image.

ULOS 21.09-r1.7:
  *  Release 1.7.
  *  Cynosure's TTY now properly supports 24-bit color.
  *  The `ANSI_COLOR` field in `/etc/os-release` has been updated to `38;2;102;182;255`;  it was previously `96`.
  *  A bug with Cynosure's `load()` wrapper where a `for` specifier would sometimes not be recognized has been fixed.
  *  Writing to a broken pipe now sends the `SIGPIPE` signal to the offending process.
  *  The TTY's signal sending logic has been fixed.
  *  There is a new shell available, `bsh`.  Its design is similar to the Bourne shell.
  *  The `sh` script now points to whatever the user's shell is.
  *  The old `sh` bourne-like shell has been removed.
  *  Cynosure's managed filesystem driver no longer errors when passed an empty file path.
  *  The `HOSTNAME` and `PWD` environment variables are now set by default.
  *  The default shell has changed to `/bin/sh`.
  *  Added `/bin/echo`, which behaves exactly as it should.
  *  The ULOS Package Manager now checks for conflicting packages during installation.
  *  `io.popen` should behave as expected now.
  *  `network:read()` should work properly now.
  *  `FILE*` streams are now unbuffered if the buffer mode is set to `pipe` as well as if it is set to `none`.
  *  All of a process's I/O streams are now properly closed when a process exits, unless they point to a TTY.
  *  `/sys/dev/null` now exists as an empty file into which all that is written disappears.
  *  `/bin/login` now passes `--login` to the shells it executes.
  *  `readline()` now accepts an `exit` option to set the function it calls when Control-D is pressed.
  *  `ls` now exits with a status of 1 if a file or directory is not found, rather than ignoring it.
  *  Cynosure's TTY colors now use the full 16 palette colors available for exact color matching.
  *  Cynosure now supports color profiles and custom colors for the TTY.  This allows switching between terminal palettes with a kernel argument.  These themes are: The default (1), the Breeze theme from Konsole (2), Gruvbox (3), Gruvbox Light (4), PaperColor light (5), and Pale Night (6).
  *  Cynosure's `loadfile()` now supports shebangs.  This eliminates the need for the shell to support them.
  *  Cynosure now adds support to `checkArg` for the first `n` argument to be a string.  This is useful for functions where arguments are provided in a table.
  *  The coreutils' `lua` REPL now parses arguments exactly as does the PUC-Rio interpreter.
  *  The official UPM repositories have moved to http://ulos.pickardayune.com.
  *  The `text` library's `wrap` function now word-wraps.  It will also preserve the indentation of a line across wraps, such that manual pages now look significantly better.
  *  There are now manual pages for `tle`.
  *  `argutil` now has a `getopt` function, with the manual page updated accordingly.
  *  Fixed a small bug in `less` when jumping down a page.
  *  `less` now supports searching for a pattern within its buffer.
  *  Cynosure now (at least in theory) supports the Minitel networking stack.
  *  Fixed a bug in `cp` when copying a single file into a directory.
  *  There is now a `lshw` command.  It doubles as a `components` implementation when given the `-o` or `--openos` options.
  *  `mount` now prints a more easily readable form of the output from `/sys/mounts` when invoked with no arguments.
  *  `passwd` has a new flag, `--clear-acls`, to clear all ACLs before processing `--enable` or `--disable`.
  *  Fixed a small bug with `df`.
  *  UWM now checks whether the GPU supports VRAM buffers before launching.
  *  Cynosure now caches `loadfile()` results for 60 seconds after the final time they are used, or until the system runs low on memory.  This provides a moderate performance boost in the shell and other apps, while still allowing the system to run on 384KB of RAM.
  *  File reads now support pre-emption.
  *  The `sysfs`'s `filesystem` component handler now strips trailing newlines when setting filesystem labels.
  *  Cynosure's `checkArg` now supports being given a string as the first argument, and will show the function name in the error
  *  Fixed a few small bugs with `tle`.

ULOS 21.10:
  *  Release 21.10.  Releases will now be roughly month-aligned.
  *  Fixed an issue with `edit` where the bottom bar would sometimes scroll up.
  *  UPM now uses semantic versions, and has been updated accordingly to version 2.0.0.  **Upgrade to this release with `upm upgrade -f` or the upgrade will fail.**
  *  The `upm` package now contains a semantic versioning library, `semver`.
  *  `less`'s scrolling has been greatly optimized and is now much faster and smoother.
  *  Fixed a minor bug with the Cynosure TTY's `\27[S` function.
  *  Fixed pipes in `bsh` misbehaving when a process uses `os.execute`.
  *  There is now a `getty` package available, providing a service that automatically starts a login prompt on any TTY that does not already have a service assigned to it.
  *  There are now manual pagees documenting Cynosure's VT100 support, as well as a brief history of the ANSI specification.
  *  `bsh` now sets the process working directory to the user's home directory on login.
  *  Added `--help` and `--version` options to `bsh`.
  *  Fixed a bug with Cynosure's filesystem API.
  *  Added a `finish_after_arg` option to `argutil.getopt`.
  *  USysD's service management API now uses a request queue internally, so that services are always spawned from the `init` process.
  *  The `sudo` utility is now its own package, and requires the `sudo` service to be running in order to function.  However, its policies are now different, and user credentials are "remembered" for 5 minutes after each `sudo` invocation.
  *  Switched `bsh` to use `argutil.getopt` over `argutil.parse`.
  *  The `sh` script now passes all arguments recieved to the shell it executes.
  *  Fixed the `minstall` installer not fully working when running from the same medium that is its target.
  *  Cynosure will now panic if `init`'s exit status is nonzero.
  *  Cynosure's `FILE*` implementation now returns itself from `:write()`.  This was an oversight and has been fixed.
  *  There is now a `netutils` package available, containing a `wget` utility.
  *  The installer's online mode finally no longer clobbers `/init.lua` (by installing CLDR) except as the last step.

ULOS 21.12:
  *  Release 21.12.
  *  Fixed a bug with starting services in USysD.
  *  Added a new function, `message()`, to Cynosure's `process` API.
