// ULOS //

a Unix-Like OS for OpenComputers.  I need to stop writing these.

Structured similarly to Apotheosis, but hopefully with a slightly better architecture.

// REQUIREMENTS

To build ULOS, you'll need a working install of Lua 5.3, a *nix-like system supporting `io.popen`, `mkdir`, and `cd`, as well as `cmd1; cmd2` in the shell.  You'll also need MoonPlus, as the buildfiles are written in MoonPlus.

Make sure to clone with `--recursive`, since the repository has submodules.

To build, just run `./build` from the repository root.
